express.json()
    express.json() is a built-in middleware in Express that parses incoming JSON requests and makes the JSON data available in req.body

cors()
    cors() is a middleware function from the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) package that enables secure cross-origin requests in an Express application.
    By default, web browsers block requests coming from different origins (e.g., frontend on http://localhost:3000 and backend on http://localhost:5000). cors() allows the backend to accept requests from other origins.

In simple words, layout.jsx in Next.js is like a wrapper that surrounds all pages and keeps common UI elements (like the header, footer, or sidebar) in one place.

Instead of adding these elements manually on every page, layout.jsx applies them automatically to all pages in your app. ðŸš€

what goes into the children
ChatGPT said:
The children prop in layout.jsx represents the content of the current page being rendered.

For example, if you're on the /about page, children will be the content of that page. If you're on /contact, children will be the contact page.

It allows the layout to stay the same (e.g., keeping the navbar, footer, etc.) while swapping out the main page content dynamically.



app/page.js â†’ Renders the homepage (/)
app/about/page.js â†’ Renders the About page (/about)
app/contact/page.js â†’ Renders the Contact page (/contact)

the page.js Inside every folder is the main content of that particular folder.

How Pagination Works in MongoDB
    .skip(skip): Skips the first N documents.
    .limit(limit): Limits the number of documents returned.

const todos = await Todo.find().skip(5).limit(5);
    This skips the first 5 todos and returns the next 5 todos (todos 6-10).
